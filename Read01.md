## What is component

* A component is a software object that encapsulates specific functionality or a group of functionalities and is designed to interact with other components. It has a clearly defined interface and follows a specified behavior that other components in an architecture should follow.

## What are the charactistics of a component?

* Reusability − Components are typically built to be utilized in a variety of contexts and applications. Some components, on the other hand, may be tailored to a specific purpose.

* Replaceable − Components can be swapped out for similar components at any time.

* Not context specific − Components are made to work in a variety of locations and situations.

* Extensible − To provide new behavior, a component can be extended from existing components.

* Encapsulated − A component represents the interfaces that allow the caller to use its functionality, but it does not reveal any internal processes, variables, or state.

* Independent − Components are made to be as independent as possible.

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

* Ease of deployment As new compatible versions become available, it becomes easier to update older versions without affecting other components or the system as a whole.

* Reduced costs Using third-party components helps you to stretch the expense of development and maintenance out over a longer period of time.

* Components use well-known interfaces to offer defined functionality, allowing development to take place without affecting other elements of the system.

* Reusable components allow developers and system administrators to share development and maintenance costs across multiple applications or systems.

* Productivity in software development, both now and in the future.

* Modification of technical complexity Through the usage of a component container and its services, a component can change the complexity.

* Reliability The entire system's reliability improves when the reliability of each individual component improves the overall system's reliability through reuse.

* Maintenance and evolution of the system are simple to change and update without affecting the rest of the system.

* Components must be self-contained and connected in a flexible manner. Different groups develop components independently and in concurrently.

## What is props short for?

* React is a component-based technology that breaks down the user interface into smaller, reusable chunks. In some circumstances, those components will need to communicate (transfer data to one another), and the best method to do so is to use props.

## How are props used in React?

1) To begin, identify an attribute and its value (data).
2) Then, using Props, send it to the child component(s).
3) Last but not least, render the Props.

## What is the flow of props?

* This principle implies that data can only be sent to other portions of the program in one method. Unidirectional data flow or one-way binding are terms used to describe one-way data flow.
